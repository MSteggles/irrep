This directory contains Abinit's input files needed to calculate the bands of CuBi2O4 whose irreducible representations have been computed with `IrRep` and worked out is in the paper. The aformentioned files are in the directory `dft_inputs` and the `IrRep` command needed to reproduce the results in the file `run.sh`. The `WFK` file with the wave functions is not included as takes to much memory.
